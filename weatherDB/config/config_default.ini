; The data files are stored in the data directory.
; The path can be a relative path to the module directory or an absolute path.
; if they are stored somewhere else set the path here

[data:rasters]
; Digital elevation models (DEM)
; The paths can be a relative paths to the DATA_BASE_DIR or an absolute path.
; The module needs at least one DEM to calculate the horizon shadowing angle.
; as finer DEM are sometimes not covering the whole area of germany+40km, that is needed, you can add additional DEMs, that gets used if the first one
; the DEMs are used in the order of appearance in the list

; Regionalisation Rasters
; the module works with regionalised multi-annual rasters from the DWD
; the module needs at least the HYRAS and DWD raster, as this is the basis for the regionalisation of the station data
; The rasters should be in a cartesian coordinate system with meter as unit to be able to calculate distances (e.g. EPSG:3035)
