; The connection setting defines which connection is used if not specified

; The password should not be stored in the config file, as it is a security risk.

; Possible values: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

; The log directory
; The path can contain the module path as basis with ${main:module_path} or the complete path.

; The log file template
; The log file will be named with the template and rotated daily with the date appended
; The template can contain the computer host name with {host} and the current user name with {user}

; The log file format
; The format can contain the following variables:
; {asctime} - the time of the log entry

; {levelname} - the log level
; {message} - the log message
FORMAT = %(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s

[data]
; The weatherDB module needs several data files to work properly.
; those files are only used by the main managing module, not by the users.

; The data files like multi annual and dems rasters are normaly stored in the data directory.
; The path can contain the module path as basis with ${main:module_path} or the complete path.
; if they are stored somewhere else set the path here

[data:rasters]
; Digital elevation models (DEM)
; The paths can contain the module path as basis with ${main:module_path} or the DATA.BASE_DIR with ${data:BASE_DIR} or the complete path.
; The module needs at least one DEM to calculate the horizon shadowing angle.
; as finer DEM are sometimes not covering the whole area of germany+40km, that is needed, you can add additional DEMs, that gets used if the first one
; the DEMs are used in the order of appearance in the list

; Regionalisation Rasters
; the module works with regionalised multi-annual rasters from the DWD
; the module needs at least the HYRAS and DWD raster, as this is the basis for the regionalisation of the station data
; The rasters should be in a cartesian coordinate system with meter as unit to be able to calculate distances (e.g. EPSG:3035)
