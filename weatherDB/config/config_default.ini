; The logging settings
; Should the log be written to a file or to the console
; Possible values: file, console
LOG_TO = console

; The log level
; Possible values: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

; The path can contain the module path as basis with ${main:module_path} or the complete path.
; if the log should be written to the console, this setting is ignored

[data]
; The weatherDB module needs several data files to work properly.
; those files are only used by the main managing module, not by the users.

; The data files like multi annual and dems rasters are normaly stored in the data directory.
; The path can contain the module path as basis with ${main:module_path} or the complete path.
; if they are stored somewhere else set the path here
BASE_DIR = ${main:module_path}/data

[data:rasters]
; Digital elevation models (DEM)
; The paths can contain the module path as basis with ${main:module_path} or the DATA.BASE_DIR with ${data:BASE_DIR} or the complete path.
; The module needs at least one DEM to calculate the horizon shadowing angle.
; as finer DEM are sometimes not covering the whole area of germany+40km, that is needed, you can add additional DEMs, that gets used if the first one
; the DEMs are used in the order of appearance in the list

       ${data:BASE_DIR}/dgms/DGM80.tif

; Regionalisation Rasters
; the module works with regionalised multi-annual rasters from the DWD
; the module needs at least the HYRAS and DWD raster, as this is the basis for the regionalisation of the station data
; The rasters should be in a cartesian coordinate system with meter as unit to be able to calculate distances (e.g. EPSG:3035)

[data:rasters:hyras]
; multi annual HYRAS raster
; The original data can be found on: https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/multi_annual/hyras_de/precipitation/
; to get better results, we refined the 1km rasters to 25m raster, based on a DEM25. (this file is not providen, but can be asked for)
