## Version 0.0.45

- remove REGNIE from data-sources, ass the DWD is not providing it anymore -> wasn't really used anymore

## Version 0.0.44

- add a check in the post fillup scalling method to not exceed the maximum treshold of $50mm/10min$

## Version 0.0.43

- add check for active broker session to more methods of Broker
- reorganize the cli interface. Now there is also the option to only do the quality control, richter correction, filling or update the raw data without updating all of the database. Furthermore the database version can get set to the actual version.

## Version 0.0.42

- add a quality check for precipitations: remove single peaks above 5 mm/10min
- change the method to scale 10 minute precipitation to daily measurements:
  - Add a maximum treshold of changing the measurement to add at maximum $10mm/10min$, if the scaling would like to add more rain, then it is cutten to this maximum.
  - prevent creating single peaks higher than $5mm/10min$ through this scaling process. If the scalling would create higher single peaks, then the value is set to $5mm/10min$

## Version 0.0.41

- add a maximum treshold of $50mm/10min$ as a quality check for precipitations

## Version 0.0.40

- change roger_toolbox format to keep minute and hour values even if daily aggregation

## Version 0.0.39

- add the RoGeR Toolbox format as timeseries format. See https://github.com/Hydrology-IFH/roger for more specifications on the format
- only insert needed download time if DB_ENG is super user
- add possibility to change the column names and filenames of written out weather timeserires

## Version 0.0.38

- fix problem when updating the Richter correction to only a period.
  Previously the Richter correction did only work, when applied to the whole period (period=(None,None)).
  When a smaller period was selected, everything outside of this period got set to NULL.
  This problem existed since Version 0.0.36
- update pattern to find meta file, DWD has a second file in kl daily folder, having "mn4" in name

## Version 0.0.37

- create_ts: skip period check if already done in GroupStation or GroupStations -> previously this got checked 3 times
- add functionality to StationsBase.get_df to get multiple columns
- fix error in richter_correct from previous version

## Version 0.0.36

- throw error if Richter correction is done on empty filled timeserie
- add test for filled daily values before adjusting the 10 minute values in the fillup
- fix errors in fillup for Temperature stations
- set autocommit for _drop method
- richter_correct: only update corr when new values -> way faster
- only give aggregated value if at least 80% data is available

## Version 0.0.35

- set filled_by for T stations default to NULL not [NULL] -> works better with other methods
- change date parsing for read dwd function, to work with pandas version >2.0

## Version 0.0.34

- StationsBase.get_meta: strip whitespace in str columns
- add min/max-tresholds for T and ET
- add -9999 as possible NA value for DWD data

## Version 0.0.33

- change quality control of T- & ET-Stations -> add inversion consideration for stations above 800m altitude
  Those stations values are only sorted out in winter if their difference to the median neighbor station is negative (lower limit)
- change quality control of T and ET -> the values are now getting compared to the median of 5 neighbors, not the mean
- change fillup method: has now the possibility to take the median of multiple neighboring stations to fillup. This possibility is now used for Temperature stations, where 5 neighboring stations are considered.

## Version 0.0.32

- add elevation consideration for the selection of neighboring stations, based on LARSIM formula for the quality_check and fillup procedure of T and ET. So not only the closest stations are selected but sometimes also a station that is further away, but has les difference in height.
- get neighboring stations for T and ET quality check for full years, to always have around 5 neighboring stations
- fix problem in get_multi_annual for T Station if no ma found
- fix error because timeseries did only get created when, station T or ET is in meta_n table, even if they exist in meta_t or meta_et. So e.g a T Station exists in meta table because of own data, but is not added because no P station is there.

## Version 0.0.31

- only compare to neighboring stations if at least 2 stations have data in the quality check of T and ET
- add settings to the database and broker now updates the whole database if a new version is loaded
- stop broker execution if another broker instance is activly updating the database

## Version 0.0.30

- fix MAJOR error in Temperature quality check: The coefficient did not get converted to the database unit.
  This had as a consequence, that the neighboring values did not get regionalised correctly to the checked station. So if the neighboring station has big difference in the multi annual temperature value, too many values got kicked out.
  This error existed probably since version 0.0.15

## Version 0.0.29

-add calculation of dropped values in quality check

## Version 0.0.28

- MAJOR Error fix: The quality check for T and ET did not consider the decimal multiplier for the limits. So the table 2 from the Method documentation should have looked like this until now, in bold are the numbers that were wrong in the code:

| parameter | compare equation | lower limit | upper limit|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Temperature |  $$\Delta T = T_{Stat} - \overline{T}_{neighbors}$ | $\Delta T < -\mathbf{0.5}째C$ | $\Delta T > \mathbf{0.5}째C$$ |
| pot. Evapotranspiration |  $\delta ET = \dfrac{ET_{Stat}}{\overline{ET}_{neighbors}}$ | $\begin{cases}\delta ET< \mathbf{20}\% \\ ET_{Stat}> \mathbf{0.2} \frac{mm}{d}\end{cases}$|$\begin{cases}\delta ET> 200\% \\ ET_{Stat}> \mathbf{0.3} \frac{mm}{d}\end{cases}$|

Those limits got corrected to correspond now to:
| parameter | compare equation | lower limit | upper limit|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Temperature |  $\Delta T = T_{Stat} - \overline{T}_{neighbors}$ | $\Delta T < -\mathbf{5}째C$ | $\Delta T > \mathbf{5}째C$ |
| pot. Evapotranspiration |  $\delta ET = \dfrac{ET_{Stat}}{\overline{ET}_{neighbors}}$ | $\begin{cases}\delta ET< \mathbf{25}\% \\ ET_{Stat}> \mathbf{2} \frac{mm}{d}\end{cases}$|$\begin{cases}\delta ET> 200\% \\ ET_{Stat}> \mathbf{3} \frac{mm}{d}\end{cases}$|
- fixed error that came up in version 0.0.27 for richter correction. The horizon was only calculated from west to south not from north to south.
- correct update_horizon to also consider that the distance between grid cells can be diagonal to the grid, so miultiply with $\sqrt{2}$

## Version 0.0.27

- fixed major error with update_horizon method. Therefor the Richter Exposition classe changes for many stations. This error existed since Version 0.0.15
- add multiprocess ability to update_richter_class

- add compatibility for shapely >2.0
## Version 0.0.23

- change pandas to_csv parameter line_terminator to lineterminator, for newer versions

- fix removal of old log files
## Version 0.0.21

- add additional parameter sql_add_where to define a sql where statement to filter the created results in the database
